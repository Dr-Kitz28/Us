# ARCHIVED: Azure Terraform placeholders

This folder previously contained placeholder Terraform modules for Azure (AKS/VNet/Postgres).
The project has been consolidated to AWS for Terraform wiring. These files are retained for
historical reference but are not used by the root Terraform configuration.

If you need Azure support in the future, restore or replace these placeholders.
